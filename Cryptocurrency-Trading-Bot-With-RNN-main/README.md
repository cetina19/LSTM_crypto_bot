# Internship at Artifik (https://www.artifik.no)
## ETH Trading Bot with RNN (LSTM)

This project is part of my internship at **Artifik**, where I developed a cryptocurrency trading bot using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict ETH (Ethereum) prices based on the correlation with **Peruvian Sol (PEN)** and **Turkish Lira (TRY)** exchange rates.

### Key Features:
- **Peruvian Sol (PEN)** (Pearson Correlation = 0.82) and **Turkish Lira (TRY)** (Pearson Correlation = 0.71) were used as features to predict ETH price.
- The **model accuracy** achieved is above 80%.
- **Final results**, including model performance and predictions, can be found in the **Results** folder.
